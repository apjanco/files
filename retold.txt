#Prologue
Gilgamesh knew he understood
how the waters broke how the world was birthed
the weight of life heavy as a flood
the full womb the still grave
He sensed secrets guarded by gods
wandered wide told a tale
dreaded death longed for light
found and lost his first love
Often he travelled Shamash's warrior
just as the sun god circles the earth
Gilgamesh built the wall of Uruk
a strong strand circling his city
See these bricks from river mud
the rustle of reeds in winter is in them
the hubbub of storms in summer is in them
the smell of Euphrates and Tigris is in them
As many bricks as birds fly west
dried to hardness on Uruk's roofs
creating a temple for holy Inanna
and inside the temple a casket of cedar
Inside the cedar the memory of forests
where Enkidu ran with his herd of gazelles
where Gilgamesh fought the giant Humbaba
to bring back wood to the city of Uruk

told by the tribe
his own story
of Gilgamesh
at the Edge of the World
of Gilgamesh on the Waters of Death
How he found the Flood survivor
in a far place found Uta-napishtim
how he greeted the goddess Siduri
how he lost his life-giving plant
Mighty and handsome a glorious hero
unmatched in combat none could defeat him
his people kept safe in the sheepfold of Uruk
surpassing all kings his name is a legend
#The Coming of Enkidu
A hurricane moved the mind of Gilgamesh
Tornado of tantrums | he shattered the city
Even his mother veiled her face
Even the gods were goaded to gall.
At last they called | the goddess Aruru
Fertile womb goddess | who made the first humans
She made life spurt | from the mud of the river
She made life spring | from the clay of the uplands.
The great Aruru knew the right answer
To fashion a man | equal to Gilgamesh
An untamed man | to tame the
tyrant
An untaught man | to teach him secrets.
Out of the silence out of the sunlight
Out of the shadows | that carpet the forest
Stepped a man, beautiful | strong like an eagle
Stepped I a man, god-like | lithe as a lion.
His hair rolled down | like waves of a torrent
His beard luxuriant | bushy as barley
Dense and waving | the hair of his body
Like an animal god | he stood in the forest.
A grazing animal | joining his herd
Gazelles ran round him | down to the water-hole
He ran with the animals | down to the water-hole
This was Enkidu | made for Gilgamesh.
A hunter saw him | saw him by chance
Gazelles running freely | Enkidu with them
A giant was Enkidu | naked and powerful
Lord of Wild Nature | protecting his beasts.
The hunter crouched | quiet in the moonlight
Secretly watched from safety of shadows
This was the wolf-man | emptying his traps
This was the wild-dog | springing his snares.
Angry and fearful | he travelled to Uruk
Told Gilgamesh | who listened with care
Commanded the hunter | to tell him each detail
He'd seen Enkidu | before in a dream.
Gilgamesh frowned | said to the hunter
'Go quickly and find | the hierodule Shamhat
Like a gazelle | she waits in the temple
Offering herself | in Inanna's service.
Take her with you to the place in the forest
The place where the wild man | drinks from the lake
Tell her to lie undressed by the water-hole
She must be naked | a beautiful snare.
Once they've had sex | his herd will desert him
Once he has known | the bliss of her body
He'll want to follow her out of the forest
Follow her back to the city of Uruk.
Three days they walked | the hunter and Shamhat
Away from the city | out into the country
Three more they waited | there by the water-hole
Waiting to lure the wild man Enkidu.
Shamhat was sitting | quiet by the pool's edge
Watching the flickering | fish in the shallows
When suddenly Enkidu | stood there before her
She took in his odour of forest and hillside.
The hierodule gasped as he bent to touch her
Stroking her hair | like the fur of an animal
Stroking her thighs | like the flanks of an animal
As he caressed her | he sang to her softly.
Inanna looked down | blessing the lovers
Six days, seven nights | their bodies were joined
Six days, seven nights | their flesh was one flesh
Six days, seven nights | their souls were one soul.
On day number seven | they rested together
Then Enkidu set off | to re-join his herd
But now gazelles ran | flung fearful glances
Hoof-beats soon distant | a patter of thunder.
Slowly he came back | sat down by Shamhat
There by the lake | they started to talk
"Why not come back with me to the city
Open your eyes to the splendours of Uruk.
|
All day, you'll find | there is singing and dancing
Tambours and cymbals | reed pipes and lyres
Come to the temple | of blessed Inanna
See golden statues and tablets of lapis.
And there's Gilgamesh | manly and handsome
Even taller than you | even stronger, more virile
His hair thick as yours | like a field of ripe barley
Eyes dark as wine | at the base of a pitcher.
Enkidu thought of his life in the forest
Untamed and free | yet lonely and friendless
Should he go now | to the city with Shamhat?
Follow the hierodule | back to the city?
'He Saw You in Dreams...
Shambat tells Enkidu that Gilgamesh is waiting for him.
Then Shamhat said, 'He first saw you in dreams,
Saw before he'd ever heard of you.
you
In the first, while watching stars, it seems
One lost its grip, and hurtling closer, grew
Gigantic, landed with such force between
The Tigris and Euphrates that a new
Crater was formed that was much larger than
The salty Sawa lake or Saturn's moon.
People crowded round it in a flock,
Wanted to kiss it, like a baby's feet.
They knelt and prayed before this piece of rock
In case it brought them luck or changed their fate,
But Gilgamesh is made from stronger stock
He put his shoulder underneath the
Meteorite, and like a little boy,
He lifted it as if it were a toy.
great
The goddess Ninsun, Gilgamesh's mother,
Explained her understanding of the dream -
A man was coming to him, a new brother,
To love and protect Gilgamesh and seem
More of a soul-mate than a friend, another
Entity that, parted in the stream
At birth, had found its own way back to meet
Itself again and make itself complete.
-
The second dream was in Uruk's main
A multitude of people clustered round
square
An axe forged in the palace blacksmith's fire
Its bulk so huge it covered all the ground
Between Inanna's temple and the far-
Off river bank. Then Gilgamesh bent down
And with a dreadful groan, he picked it up
And carried it to Ninsun, every step
Surrounded by the cheering crowd who threw
Themselves before him as he made his
way
In triumph to the palace. Now they knew
Their leader was a god, and knelt to pray
And give him thanks, while goddess Ninsun drew
Gilgamesh to her saying, "Soon the day
Approaches when at last you'll meet this man.
He'll love and guard you like no other can."
#Enkidu's Decision
Shamhat continues to persuade Enkidu to come back with her to Uruk.
Later that day, she turned to him and said
Like Gilgamesh you have a god-like image.
Why show your beauty only to your herd?
Year after
year, why be content to forage
In the woods, a lonely soul, until,
like creeping undergrowth, the pains of age
fetter
your body with a numbing chill
and you expire unknown beneath some tree
with nobody to mourn you but an owl?
Come to Uruk now and you will see
A world of wonders that will make you stare
At every turn; a hive, a tapestry
Alive with colours; in the temple square
Exorcists, dancers, eunuchs, priestesses
Mix with more humble souls who travel there
To offer sacrifices to the goddess,
Great Inanna, who is Uruk's queen.
And lining all the streets and terraces
Tall citrus trees and date palms cast a green
And welcome shade from Shamash's strong rays
Which, glimmering through leaves, still catch the sheen
Of gold on parapets and balconies.
carries out their skill or trade:
Each
person
And here you'll also find your rightful place.
The forest with its gritty footpaths made
A sound as if it shifted on its bed
And hung its heavy canopy,:
afraid
Of portents in the wind, and what she said;
Of how the sunset turned the river red;
Of how there was a sudden smell of blood.
#Enkidu and Gilgamesh
Finally persuaded by Shamhat, Enkidu decides to travel to Uruk
to meet Gilgamesh. On the way they stop at a shepherd's camp.
head were hills that leaned against the sky
A At first dark green, then pale and paler still
away
And wooded valleys, echoing with birds,
With coils of mist that thinned then fell
Allowing beams of light to drape the land.
For the first time Enkidu saw it all -
Expanses spread before his narrowed eyes
Not flecked with shade like his known forest paths
But all laid bare and open in the sun.
They travelled on, and when at last the moon
Rose high above the distant citadels
They smelt the scent of herbs and roasting lamb
And saw the firelight of a:
shepherd's camp.
Along the path they met a shepherd boy
Who led them to the camp and sat them down
Around the fire and brought them bread and beer.
then two, then three, then four, then five,
First one,
Then six, then seven jugs Enkidu downed
Then laughed, and as his monstrous shadow shrank
And lengthened with the flickering of the flames,
camp
He danced and stumbled to a piping tune
Played by the headman on a whittled reed.
Two nights he stayed awake to guard the
And in the mornings, slept until midday.
On the third day, a wedding party passed -
A caravan, with wagons loaded high
With pomegranates, dates and apricots,
Apples and plums, cherries and nectarines,
Peaches about to burst their ripened skins
Almonds and figs and every type of sweet.
'We're headed east, to Uruk, one man said,
And I've been paid to bring the bridal feast.
'Let's go with them, Shamhat,' said Enkidu
'At least we'll eat and drink along the way.
So as the
party rested, Enkidu
Sat while the barber, carrying out his trade,
Shaved off the wild man's pelt of matted fur,
Massaged his body with sweet-smelling oil
Then washed and combed the hair which, from his head
Flowed down his back in undulating waves.
As Enkidu stood up and faced the sun
A little cloud that hid Shamash's face
Suddenly moved and Shamash, gazing down,
Turned Enkidu into a statue made
and said
Of gold. The barber rubbed his eyes
'Like Gilgamesh, this man must be a god.
'Why do you stare?' asked Enkidu, surprised,
As all the camp, in silence, looked at him.
His beauty for a moment stopped their speech.
Yet far away, under the forest's boughs
A small gazelle still searched for him in vain
And others sniffed the air to catch his scent
But there was nothing carried on the wind
And in his mind no thought of them was left.
So when they walked, next day, into the square
That lay between the temple and the street
Where Uruk's weavers dyed and spun their wool
Into the glorious cloths that made their name,
And people stopped to stare at him and kneel
As he passed by, he laughed and said, "They seem
To like me here!' Among the wedding guests
The mood grew loud as they approached the house
Where Gilgamesh prepared to have first sex
With the young bride. This troubled Enkidu.
Two at a time, he climbed the marble steps
And shoved away the guardians at the door
Then battered with his fists until the wood
Became a roaring drum to show his
rage.
'Gilgamesh, what! Are you an animal?
I've learned from Shamhat how your citizens
and care;
Treat one another with respect
Yet now you show your city's darker face
Which makes the feral beasts I've lived with seem
Of higher nature, kinder than yourself!'
The door he pounded slowly opened. Then
Into the light stepped Gilgamesh himself.
Tall as a pillar of the temple, huge
And god-like, this immense colossus
Flung his shadow over Enkidu,
Grabbed the door and hurled it from its hinge;
Then like two bulls set loose, or massive bears
Reared
I up against each other, or a pair
Of deep-sea monsters whose collision rocks
The earth's foundation to its very core,
They fought. They had no weapons but their own
Bodies, each a hard, unyielding cage
Of muscle, iron bands that smashed together
With such power the lintel cracked and buckled,
Pigeons nesting in the crevices
Of brick flew upwards in a clattering flock
And in the crowd babies began to wail
In terror as their mothers hurried them
Away. First Gilgamesh then Enkidu
Seemed to be winning. Each one had the strength
Of fifty soldiers in the peak of fitness.
As they wrestled on the ground their veins
Stood out like drainpipes on a ziggurat,
Their sinews bulged to bursting and the sweat
Ran down their skin and made clay with the dust.
After two hours, Gilgamesh knelt and said
To Enkidu, 'Wild man, you are the first
That's ever been my equal in a fight.
He took Enkidu's hand and raised him up
Then held him in his arms. The two men stood
Embracing as if made of marble like
Some carving on a palace wall that seems
So lifelike it could walk away and leave
An empty shape, a story to be told
That changes with the teller and the telling.
Gilgamesh said, 'I saw you first in dreams...
'A rock and axe, I think, Enkidu smiled,
'Shamhat has told me. Then, as if no other
Words were worthy of their breath, they walked
Together, wordless, hand in hand towards
The palace where the goddess Ninsun waited
To receive them. 'You have come at last,
She said to Enkidu, 'My flesh and blood.
Although you
didn't come from my own womb
I love like a mother loves a son;
you
You'll be brother for my Gilgamesh.
You'll be a rock to keep him safe, an axe
To guard him and to also set him free.
You'll love him more than life itself and be
you
A faithful servant to him 'til die.
On his hand she put a jasper ring
And round his neck a medal made of gold.
Lord of Wild Places he had been before
And now, the friend of Gilgamesh, whose name
Would carry on forever with his own.
Soon the friends began to make new plans
Daring deeds, adventures still to come
'We'll travel to the forest, find and kill
The giant who guards it, bring back cedar wood
To shore
up Uruk's wall, Gilgamesh said.
The forest shifted on its bed and sighed.
It flickered in Enkidu's mind as if
It brushed up close. He said, 'I knew him when
I roamed the uplands - Humbaba, his speech
Is fire, his breath is death! Enlil has
put
Him there to guard the cedars of the gods!
He hears each leaf detach itself and fall
And every raindrop tremble on its twig
And
every fawn open its new-born eyes
Across the sixty leagues of wilderness.
A journey there would be our certain end.
of Gilgamesh grew hard as stone.
He would have killed a lesser man who had
The
eyes
The courage to defy his will. 'Weakling!'
He said, 'Your spineless words make me despair!
Aren't you the one that lions feared and wolves
Obeyed? Where is your backbone? Have you none?'
'Humbaba, his speech is fire, his breath
Is death!' repeated Enkidu. If we
So much as put a toe inside his home
We'll be dead men, or even worse, still living
But afflicted with such agues and shakes
And tremors of the heads and hands, it would
Be better if we'd died!' But Gilgamesh
Was fixed in purpose. To the elders' court
He now dragged Enkidu to put their case.
They heard, 'His speech is fire, his breath is death!'
From Enkidu and shuddered at the risks
Their young and reckless king proposed to take.
But there was nothing that could change his mind;
And Enkidu knew then, whatever fate
Waited for Gilgamesh would also be
His own; and vowing to protect his lord,
Enkidu, in that moment pledged his life
And swore obedience to Gilgamesh.
The Goddess Ninsun Prays to the Sun God,
Shamash
Gilgamesh asks his mother, the goddess Ninsun,
for her blessing on their plans and, knowing she can't
deter them, Ninsun begs Shamash to protect them.
His mind resolved his purpose fixed
Flung these fearful | words at Shamash:
'Why have
you I made my son so restless?'
Seven times she went into the sanctum
Seven times crossed | the sacred threshold
Seven times smoothed herself with oils
With myrrh and cleansing bergamot.
Then she
put on a clinging dress
Hung precious pendants | round her breasts
Heightened herself | with a high headdress
Crowned with gems | she outshone Aya.
She outshone the sun's own bride
She lit up the dawn's first:
rays.
Her harlots bowed themselves in awe
Before this lady charged with light.
Step by step she climbed the stair
Approached the shrine | of sun god Shamash
As she walked her censer swung
Sweet-smelling incense | pearled the air.
'Oh Shamash -
when you open
the gates of morning for the herds to stream out,
and barley and wheat awake in the earth...
Oh Shamash
when your touch glistens the fur of wild animals,
and princes of the sky and underworld bow down to you...
Keep your burning eye on Gilgamesh and Enkidu
On the way to the cedar forest make the long road short
On the way to the cedar forest make the short day long
On the
way to the cedar forest
Keep your burning eye on Gilgamesh and Enkidu
Command the moon | to guard them at night.
Summon the stars to stand as sentries
And when you wake at the first light
Let Aya remind you to harness the winds.
South wind, north wind east wind, west
The counterblasts and tornadoes
The scorching winds | the freezing winds
The storms and gales | and hurricanes.
Let them batter | bold Humbaba
From each side their forces hurl
Hold him rigid helpless; then
Let Gilgamesh | deal him his death.
Through your sacred fire
Through myrrh's embers
Grant
my desire! Hear me!
Oh Shamash, grant my
desire.'

After seventy miles they stopped to eat.

'Wait for him,' said Enkidu
'Wait for Zaqar, god of dreams.
He brings signals from the moon.
He brings signs from far away.
Across the doorway down he lay
a net against the watchful world.
Gilgamesh rested until sleep
spilled over him a heavy cloak.
When the moon was at its height,
Gilgamesh woke up stiff with fear:
"The god has turned my blood to ice!
Zaqar has sent me my first dream.
You and I were on a plain
when a mountain fell on us.
As we died our breath was frost,
our ghosts became the falling snow.
'My friend, fear not,' said Enkidu,
'Your dream is good and means all's well.
The worse the dream the better for us,
for this is Zaqar's secret sign.
The mountain you saw isn't Humbaba,
it comes from us, it's our own strength.
We'll strike him down and leave him dead,
for lions and bears to tear apart.

I shouted as it threw me down.
A man appeared and caught me safe,
then from my face he wiped the blood,
he placed his arm beneath my head,

was none other than your father.

Be legends 'til the end of time!'
The Battle with Humbaba
The friends reach the cedar forest and enter it,
preparing to fight the giant Humbaba, appointed
by the deities as its guardian.

streaming currents. The river is snatched
from its bed and floats like a ribbon above
the forest.
He can't go sideways.
Humbaba's voice comes through the hubbub...
[HUMBABA]
[ENKIDU to GILGAMESH]
[HUMBABA]
'Spare me,
Gilgamesh!"
'We have to kill him!'
"Take what you want
but let me live,
Gilgamesh! Two-
thirds god and one-
third king... I will
serve you faithfully.
[GILGAMESH]
[ENKIDU]
'Let's spare him! We
can take what timber
we need.'
'We can't trust him!
Strike him! Strike!"
He's chained by the winds, but his eyes
move, pleading. Up the heroes climb and up
and if up terraces stretching to the sky
up as
they climb his rigid body. Then with their
swords and axes go to work, hacking through
veins and sinews 'til tough skin splits, the
neck starts to sever, creaks, cracks. The huge
head lolls for a moment as if listening to
whispers, then drops to earth with a
mountainous crash.
while
the forest screams, and
then falls silent
on Mount Cedar, the deities
stop to listen
Gilgamesh and Enkidu fell
the cedars
the gods and goddesses
look down in horror
Slipping out of the forest, sliding out from
under the canopy, dirt covered.
On the bright river their bodies shine. The
raft of lashed cedars takes an hour to walk
down, its figurehead, the head of Humbaba,
huge and solid, skin like tree bark, hair a
tangle of creepers from which the last birds
leave. Slowly the wooden snake moves into
the wide straits beyond the forest, its
barely ripples the water. Smaller it gets and
smaller, until it's just a smudge on the
horizon wiped off by a thumb

the forest floor

Inanna and Gilgamesh
Gilgamesh and Enkidu return to Uruk in triumph.
After bathing and dressing in clean clothes, Gilgamesh appears
on the palace balcony to greet the crowd.

He washed his hair so it rippled like the Tigris,
Shook it down so it shone like the Euphrates.
His body caught the sun like a muscled river,
Eyes dark as wine at the base of a pitcher.
Crowned with gold he was glorious and godly.
Gilgamesh was glorious and godly.
She took one look, it stopped her breath
As if a fire ran under her skin
As if knocked down by an iron bell
Inanna saw Gilgamesh, and fell.
Goddess of war, thunderbolt-thrower,
She shook with desire like a reed in the reed bed.
Her lungs lost their power, her voice became lower
She opened to Gilgamesh like a small flower -
'Come, love, into my sweet-smelling chamber
In a golden chariot studded with amber
Drawn by a team of lions and mules
With bridles of silver and bolts of blue lapis.
my
As you cross my threshold door will caress you,
You'll conquer my court as you conquer my heart.
Our reign will bring bounty, be fertile and fecund
goat shall have triplets, each ewe shall have twins.
Each
Our donkeys and horses shall outrace the wind
Our oxen each day shall plough a deep furrow
Our orchards and farmland shall give a full harvest
Our seas with a rich crop of silver be blessed.
Only come to me, Gilgamesh, we shall be wed
Lie close to me on my perfumed bed.
Gilgamesh turned to look at Inanna.
Looked through his lashes at holy Inanna,
Sneered, 'You! Who would marry you?
You're a dog in the road crawling with fleas.
You're a blade of frost scraping the ice
A broken door that lets the wind through
A cup that cuts the lip of the drinker
A shoe that bites the foot of its owner.
You're a palace that maims its own heroes
A fireplace that puts out its own fire
A fortress that slaughters its own soldiers
An elephant that kills its own mahout.
As if her guts had turned to whey
Inanna gasped as shock ran through her.
Like a shower of stones his insults hit.
Like
enemy troops his words attacked.
Gilgamesh felt his powers grow strong
His two-thirds god surged up inside.
Had he not killed the giant Humbaba?
Now he would humble holy Inanna.
'What became of all
your bridegrooms?
Dumuzi, your first, the beautiful youth
You fucked for months in a tangle of sheets
Then you sent him to rot in hell.
The Bright-Speckled Roller Bird, where is he?
Each night he held you to his breast
"Til you clouted him and now from the trees
He cries my wing, my wing, my wing!
You tempted Ishallanu, your father's slave
Who used to bring you baskets of dates,
When he ran from you and hid in the reeds
You turned him into a warty toad!'
Inanna's
eyes grew cold as slate
Her growl of rage a thunderous belch
The veins of her neck stood out like vines.
She words like a hail of spears:
spat
'You! You're only two-thirds god!
I'll strike the part of you that's human.
Your tears will stream like a river in spate,
I'll send a storm to crush your heart!'
Then up she climbed on columns of air
Climbed up to her father's house
On ropes of light she climbed the sky
Like a shooting star she lit up heaven.
After a day she took off her crown
Took off her crown of gold and lapis
Threw it down so she could
go faster
So she could go
faster than any
wind.
After two days she took off her breastplate
Took off her breastplate of bronze and silver
Threw it down so she could go faster
So she could go faster than any wind.
After three days she took off her anklets
Took off her anklets of amber and amethyst
Threw them down so she could go faster
So she could go faster than any wind.
After four days she took off her rings
Took off her rings of turquoise and topaz
Threw them down so she could go faster
So she could go faster than any wind.
After five days she took off her earrings
Took off her earrings of white and black onyx
Threw them down so she could go faster
So she could go
faster than any wind.
After six days she took off her girdle
Took off her girdle of jasper and jade
Threw it down so she could go faster
So she could go faster than any wind.
After seven days she took off her bangles
Took off her bangles of pyrite and pearl
Threw them down so she could go faster
So she could
go faster than any wind.
Naked, she arrived in heaven
Knelt before her father Anu
Asked him for the heavenly Sky Bull
Swore
revenge on Gilgamesh.
With the Sky Bull she'd destroy him
Kill the king, lay waste the land.
Anu said, "This can't be done
You cannot take the Bull of Heaven!
'I'll open up the gates of hell!
And wake the dead!' Inanna screamed
'I'll set them free to eat the living
There'll be no soul left on earth!'
Anu knew he could not argue
With his rampant eldest daughter.
The
gates of heaven began to tremble
And Anu let her have the Sky Bull.
Inanna called the Heavenly Bull,
Her words flew like a flock of birds.
She called again and it was night
And at her call he came to her.
Inanna led him down from heaven
Where he grazed among the planets,
Round his flanks light danced and
spun
And he was made of stars and burning.
His eyes were meteors big as moons
His tail a trail of flaming comets
Each tuft of hair a galaxy
Each breath a moving constellation.
When the Sky Bull's hoof touched down
It smashed to dust the town of Girsu
When its second hoof touched down
It set eight miles of fields ablaze.
When the bull's third hoof touched down
It opened up a nine-mile crater
When the bull's fourth hoof touched down
Ten thousand strong men toppled in.
When he bowed his head to drink
In one great gulp he drained Euphrates
When he raised his tail to piss
The Tigris rose and burst its banks.
'Shamash!' shouted Gilgamesh
'Help us kill the Bull of Heaven!
Guide our spears into his heart
Give each axe a burning edge.
Shamash saw he had a chance -
A chance to equal great Inanna,
His
rays blazed down on Sky Bull's back
And turned to salt its pelt of stars.
Bit by bit the Sky Bull shrank
Like a moon it waned and paled,
One hero grabbed it by its tail
The other grabbed it by its horns.
In its throat Gilgamesh thrust
Through sinewed chink his bitter blade.
The Sky Bull stumbled to its knees
Its bawling woke the far-off gods.
One by one its stars went out.
One by one its planets dimmed.
One by one its meteors faded.
One by one its comets vanished.
Then Gilgamesh cut out its heart
To give to Shamash their protector.
Enkidu hacked off its haunch
And hurled it in Inanna's face.
Inanna called her prostitutes
Inanna called her courtesans
Together they sang mourning rites
Over the dead Bull of Heaven.
Gilgamesh called his silversmiths
Gilgamesh called his jewellers
Told them to decorate the horns
To hang up on his palace wall.
Festivities went on all night
But later when the palace slept
Enkidu had a chilling dream
The underworld was calling him.
Erishkagel opened one eye -
A moon so cold it froze his blood.
He raised a hand to shield his face
Then she whispered, 'Come to me.
A rod of ice lay on the bed
Between himself and Gilgamesh.
The gods declared their punishment:
Enkidu must die.
#The Death of Enkidu
Over twelve nights and days Enkidu sickens and dies.
As his friend's consciousness slips away Gilgamesh is distraught with grief.
Enkidu rages against death and is visited by horrifying visions.
